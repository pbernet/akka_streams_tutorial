/**
  * Filter elements from two sources, depending on a 'zipping function', inspired by:
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74684285/iterating-over-two-source-and-filter-using-a-property-in-scala/74692534#74692534
  *
  * Doc zipLatestWith:
  * Whenever a new element appears, the zipping function is invoked with a tuple containing
  * the new element and the *last* seen element of the *other* stream
  *
  * With an unbounded stream, we get the expected reoccurring patterns:
  *
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(B,2) wins, Record(B,4) is the new element
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,4)
  * -> Record(B,4) wins, Record(A,3) AND Record(B,6) are the new elements
  * Record(A,3) vs Record(B,6)
  * -> Record(B,6) wins, Record(A,5) AND Record(B,2) are the new elements
  * Record(A,5) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(A,5) wins, Record(A,1) AND Record(B,4) are the new elements
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,4)
  * -> Record(B,4) wins, Record(A,3) AND Record(B,6) are the new elements
  * Record(A,3) vs Record(B,6)
  * -> Record(B,6) wins, Record(A,5) AND Record(B,2) are the new elements
  * Record(A,5) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(A,5) wins, Record(A,1) AND Record(B,4) are the new elements
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,4)
  * -> Record(B,4) ...
  *
  *
  * However, with a bounded stream (eg a take(10) on the sources) we get puzzling results:
  *
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(B,2) wins, Record(A,3) is the new element
  * Record(A,3) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(A,3) wins, Record(B,4) is the new element
  * Record(A,3) vs Record(B,4)
  * -> Record(B,4) wins, Record(A,5) is the new element
  * Record(A,5) vs Record(B,6)
  * -> Record(B,6) wins, Record(A,1) is the new element
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,6)
  * -> Record(B,6) wins, Record(A,3) AND Record(B,2) are the new elements
  * Record(A,3) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(A,3) wins, Record(A,5) is the new element
  * Record(A,5) vs Record(B,2)
  * -> Record(A,5) wins, Record(B,4) is the new element
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,4)
  * -> Record(B,4) wins, Record(A,3) is the new element
  * Record(A,3) vs Record(B,4)
  * -> Record(B,4) wins, Record(A,5) AND Record(B,6) are the new elements
  * Record(A,5) vs Record(B,6)
  * -> Record(B,6) wins, Record(A,1) is the new element
  * Record(A,1) vs Record(B,6)
  * -> Record(B,6)...
