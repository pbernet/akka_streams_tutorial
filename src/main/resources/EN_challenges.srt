1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:02,500
[breeze blowing faintly]

2
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,500
Mrs. Price, you can't just show up
unannounced in the middle of a semester,

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,658
and remove your son from the school.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,658
This is not acceptable.


5
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:20,999
Someone so bright and promising,

6
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,139
killing themselves
after the glamour has passed.

7
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,093
I've been feeling better
in the last couple weeks,

8
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:12,679
and I'd appreciate
you keeping some distance.

9
01:23:35,098 --> 01:23:37,267
We allow ourselves contentment...

10
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
and the heart brings us ease
in its good time.

11
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,668
So G-goo came on his own,

12
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,001
wanting a refund of a prepaid
card he bought last year?


13
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:45,715
But I told him I'd ask my boss,

14
01:32:46,710 --> 01:36:46,710
and then I texted you, Detective.
