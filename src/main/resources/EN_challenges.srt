1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:02,500
[breeze blowing faintly]

2
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,500
Mrs. Price, you can't just show up
unannounced in the middle of a semester,

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,658
and remove your son from the school.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,658
This is not acceptable.

5
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:20,999
Someone so bright and promising,

6
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,139
killing themselves
after the glamour has passed.

7
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,093
I've been feeling better
in the last couple weeks,

8
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:12,679
and I'd appreciate
you keeping some distance.

9
01:23:35,098 --> 01:23:37,267
We allow ourselves contentment...

10
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
and the heart brings us ease
in its good time.

11
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,668
So G-goo came on his own,

12
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,001
wanting a refund of a prepaid
card he bought last year?


13
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:45,715
But I told him I'd ask my boss,

14
01:32:46,710 --> 01:36:46,710
and then I texted you, Detective.

100
02:09:47,919 --> 02:09:50,018
- ALISTAIR: Okay.
- So much love to everybody.

101
02:09:50,053 --> 02:09:51,459
ALISTAIR: Love to you all.

102
02:29:52,529 --> 02:29:53,858
- Good morning.
- Morning.

103
02:29:58,634 --> 02:30:00,436
- There.
- Thank you.

200
03:03:10,382 --> 03:03:14,350
- Samuel?
- Sam.

201
03:03:14,586 --> 03:03:17,120
Sam, we're here

202
03:03:23,194 --> 03:03:25,264
Here. OK!

203
03:06:28,213 --> 03:06:30,182
Dad.

204
03:06:48,867 --> 03:06:52,838
Dad
